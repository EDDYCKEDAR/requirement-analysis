# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository contains comprehensive documentation on **Requirement Analysis**—a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It provides insights into its purpose, importance, and application, especially in relation to a booking management system. This guide is intended for software developers, product managers, analysts, and students aiming to understand or improve their requirement analysis processes.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It bridges the gap between a vague idea and a clear, actionable development plan.

In the SDLC, Requirement Analysis is essential because it:

- Lays the foundation for design and development.
- Helps uncover edge cases and user needs early.
- Reduces ambiguity by creating well-documented, traceable requirements.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- ✅ **Defines Project Scope**  
  Helps clearly define what the system will and will not do, reducing scope creep.

- ✅ **Improves Communication**  
  Acts as a shared reference point between stakeholders, designers, and developers.

- ✅ **Reduces Cost of Rework**  
  Catching requirement issues early prevents expensive changes later in development.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect raw data from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, and research.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Clarify and expand gathered information using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, or user stories.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Record requirements clearly and formally in formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyze requirements to ensure feasibility and consistency. Use models like data flow diagrams or use case diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Verify and validate the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These specify what the system **should do**—its features and behavior.

**Examples for a booking management system:**
- Users can **search** available properties by location and date.
- Users can **book** a property and receive a confirmation email.
- Admins can **add or remove** property listings.

### Non-functional Requirements

These define **how** the system performs, rather than what it does.

**Examples:**
- The site should load within **2 seconds** on a 3G connection.
- Data must be **encrypted** during transmission.
- The system should be able to handle **10,000 concurrent users**.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a visual way to represent how different actors (users or systems) interact with a system. They help stakeholders quickly understand the system’s functionality and user interactions.

### Benefits:
- Provide a high-level overview of system functionality
- Help identify system boundaries and external interactions
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders and developers

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the predefined conditions that must be met for a feature to be accepted by stakeholders or clients. They ensure that development aligns with business goals and user needs.

### Importance:
- Acts as a checklist to determine whether a feature works as expected
- Clarifies what "done" means for a feature
- Helps developers and testers validate functionality

### Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ The user can review the booking summary before finalizing.
- ✅ The payment form accepts valid credit/debit cards and shows errors for invalid entries.
- ✅ A confirmation page is shown upon successful payment.
- ✅ A booking confirmation email is sent to the user.
